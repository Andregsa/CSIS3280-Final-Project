WHEN YOU CLICK THE BUTTON WATCHED THROUGH SEARCH MODE, IT WILL GET THE ID FROM THE MOVIES STORED IN THE HOME PAGE ACCORDING TO THE FUNCTION Static function wmovies($Wm) IN PAGE.PHP. I THINK THE BEST WAY IS ADD TO DB TABLE THE IMDBID THAT IS UNIQUE FOR EACH MOVIE, AND THEN MANAGE THIS.

USE IMDb ID to store the movies in Mylist because is unique, work with TITLE and Year is not good because Year some time is not INT could be "2005-2008"

ASK THE USER TO PUT THE MOVIE RATE IN THE MOMENT THAT HE CLICK THE BUTTON WATCHED!

ADD A BUTTON IN MY LIST TO SEE MOVIE DETAILS AND ADD TO WATCHED MOVIES!

MISSING THE STATISTICS
MESSAGES 
ERROR LOGS(GET THE ERRORS FROM THE WEB SERVER)!
ADD LOGO TO THE TAB (LAB 10)
SORT MYMOCIES LIST BY YEAR & CATEGORY & TITLE
-NEED TO UPDATE THE DESC TABLES IN THE ENTITIES COMMENTS
